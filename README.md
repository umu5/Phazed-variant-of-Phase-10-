# Phazed-variant-of-Phase-10-
Phazed is a 4-player game where the objective is to be the first to complete a series of “phases” by placing particular combinations of cards on the table. The game is broken down into a series of “hands”, in each of which, the 4 players are dealt 10 cards each from a 104 card deck, and take it in turns either drawing a card from the face-down deck, or picking up the top card from the discard pile. When they have the requisite cards to complete a given phase, on their turn, they place those cards on the table, and optionally place any remaining cards on any group that has been placed on the table (their own or groups of other players). For a given hand, play continues until one of the following occurs: (1) a player places all of their cards on the table; (2) the deck is exhausted; or (3) each player has played 50 times. At the point that one of these occurs, players tally up penalty points based on the cards remaining in their hand. The game continues across multiple hands until either: (1) a player has completed all of their phases; or (2) 20 hands have been completed. In the former case, the winner is the player who completed all of their phases (or the player(s) with the lowest point score who have completed all phases, in the case of a tie); in the latter case, the player(s) with the lowest point score win.
